my interpretation:

You chose 13 cards in 2018. You want to know what the probability of choosing any 4 of those 13
again in 2019 is. There are 4c13 ways to choose these 4 cards that will match in 2019.

There are 74c13 different outcomes in the 2019 probability space. 

You are interested in the outcomes where 4 of the cards matched 2018's draws.

That is, 4 of the 13 draws in 2019 appeared in 2018, and 9 of the 13 did not occur in 2018
(assuming we're interested in only *exactly* 4, and not 4 or more). 

As we said before, there are 13c4 "valid" choices that appeared in 2018, and the rest of the
cards must come from the set of cards that didn't appear in 2018. There are 61 cards that didn't
appear in 2018, and so 61c9 ways to choose the remaining 9 cards.

(61c19 * 13c4) / 74c13 = .118
